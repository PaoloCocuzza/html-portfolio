<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Paolo Cocuzza</h2>

<p>I'm 38 years old and I live in Pozzallo (RG-Italy).
   I have a master's degree in the field of humanities and entertainment, achieved at the university La Sapienza (Rome) in 2013.
   I also have a certificate as a Music Production Technician, obtained at the APM school in Saluzzo (CN), in 2015.
</p>

<p>I'm experienced in electronic music production, but actually I'm not working in this field;
   <a href="https://soundcloud.com/wiseting">here</a> you can listen to some of my old productions.
</p>

<p>I manage a holiday home in my town, that's my actual job. I've recently abandoned my job as a commercial consultant, to dedicate 100% of my time in the study of web developement.
